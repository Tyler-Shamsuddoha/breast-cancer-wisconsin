EDA and some ML classification on the famous breast cancer dataset!

With the prerprocessing to the data it already achieves an accuracy of 96% which I think is pretty solid.  
I will also be giving other classifiers that are good at binary classifiation a go in the near future.  
An area that I would like to revisit in this ML task is the preprocessing and run Principle Component Analysis (PCA).
This would be in an attept to preserve information from some of the features that I dropped due to multicollinearity, whilst still maintaining information about the cancer cells to aid classification.

That and more to come!
